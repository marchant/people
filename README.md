[Live Demo](http://montagejs.org/apps/popcorn/)

This demo application showcases how to structure and optimize a MontageJS application for tablets.

##Installation

To run this demo locally you need:

* A web server of your choice. MontageJS applications are client-side applications with no particular back-end dependency.
* Cloned GitHub repo of this demo.

To run the Popcorn demo locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the popcorn [GitHub repo](https://github.com/montagejs/popcorn) in your desktop.

2. Spin up your preferred HTTP server and point your browser to the associated port to serve the popcorn directory.

    > During development MontageJS applications rely on XHR to load their various components and modules, which is why you will need a web server to serve the demo.

    > If you happen to have [minit](https://github.com/montagejs/minit), the Montage Initializer, installed (`npm install minit -g`) you can run `minit serve` from within the demo directory to set up a server on demand.

##Dependencies
The npm packages Popcorn depends on are versioned inside of the node_modules directory, in keeping with Node.js best practices.
To update dependencies you'll need to have node and npm installed.
